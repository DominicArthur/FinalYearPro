# FinalYearPro
This is my GitHub space for my final year project.

## What is it
This project is a reinforcement learning system that was build inside Unity using the ML-Agents toolkit. The agent is trained to act as a hider in a hide-and-seek environment. The goal is to gain important knowledge about this topic and to train an agent to hide intelligently from a seeker by using its enviornment and what it has learnet from reinforment lerning techniques.
